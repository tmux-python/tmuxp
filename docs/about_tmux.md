ISC-licensed terminal multiplexer.

:::

tmux is geared for developers and admins who interact regularly with CLI
(text-only interfaces)

In the world of computers, there are 2 realms:

1.  The text realm
2.  The graphical realm

tmux resides in the text realm. This is about fixed-width fonts and that
old fashioned black terminal.

tmux is to the console what a desktop is to gui apps. It's a world
inside the text dimension. Inside tmux you can:

- multitask inside the terminal, run multiple applications.
- have multiple command lines (pane) in the same window
- have multiple windows (window) in the workspace (session)
- switch between multiple workspaces, like virtual desktops

## Thinking tmux

- 1 {term}`Server`.

  - has 1 or more {term}`Session`.

    - has 1 or more {term}`Window`.

      - has 1 or more {term}`Pane`.

### CLI Power Tool

Multiple applications or terminals to run on the same screen by
splitting up 1 terminal into multiple.

One screen can be used to edit a file, and another may be used to
`$ tail -F` a logfile.

You can switch between the windows you create.

### Resume everything later

You can leave tmux and all applications running (detach), log out, make
a sandwich, and re-(attach), all applications are still running!

### Manage workflow

- System administrators monitor logs and services.
- Programmers like to have an editor open with a CLI nearby.

Applications running on a remote server can be launched inside of a tmux
session, detached, and reattached next timeyour ["train of
thought"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_of_thought) and work.

Multitasking. Preserving the thinking you have.

## Installing tmux

tmux is packaged on most Linux and BSD systems.

For the freshest results on how to get tmux installed on your system,
"How to install tmux on \<my distro>" will do, as directions change and
are slightly different between distributions.

This documentation is written for version **1.8**. It's important that
you have the latest stable release of tmux. The latest stable version is
viewable on the [tmux homepage](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/).

**Mac OS X** users may install that latest stable version of tmux
through [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/),
[fink](http://fink.thetis.ig42.org/) or [Homebrew](http://www.brew.sh)
(aka brew).

If **compiling from source**, the dependencies are
[libevent](http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/) and
[ncurses](http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/).

## Using tmux

### Start a new session

```bash
$ tmux
```

That's all it takes to launch yourself into a tmux session.

:::{admonition} Common pitfall
:class: note

Running `$ tmux list-sessions` or any other command for listing tmux
entities (such as `$ tmux list-windows` or `$ tmux list-panes`).
This can generate the error "failed to connect to server".

This could be because:

- tmux server has killed its' last session, killing the server.
- tmux server has encountered a crash. (tmux is highly stable,
  this will rarely happen)
- tmux has not be launched yet at all.

(prefix-key)=

### The prefix key

Tmux hot keys have to be pressed in a special way. **Read this
carefully**, then try it yourself.

First, you press the _prefix_ key. This is `C-b` by default.

Release. Then pause. For less than second. Then type what's next.

`C-b o` means: Press `Ctrl` and `b` at the same time. Release, Then
press `o`.

**Remember, prefix + short cut!** `C` is `Ctrl` key.

### Session Name

Sessions can be _named upon creation_.

```bash
$ tmux new-session [-s session-name]
```

Sessions can be _renamed after creation_.

```{eval-rst}
=============== =========================================================
Command         .. code-block:: bash

                    $ tmux rename-session <session-name>

Short cut       ``Prefix`` + ``$``
=============== =========================================================
```

### Window Name

Windows can be _named upon creation_.

```bash
$ tmux new-window [-n window-name]
```

Windows can be _renamed after creation_.

```{eval-rst}
=============== ==========================================================
Command         .. code-block:: bash

                    $ tmux rename-window <new-name>

Short cut       ``Prefix`` + ``,``
=============== ==========================================================
```

### Creating new windows

```{eval-rst}
=============== =========================================================
Command         .. code-block:: bash

                    $ tmux new-window [-n window-name]

Short cut       ``Prefix`` + ``c``

                You may then rename window.
=============== =========================================================
```

### Traverse windows

```bash
$ tmux select-window
```

Next

```bash

Recipe: tmux conf to `hjkl` commands, add this to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

    # hjkl pane traversal
    bind h select-pane -L
    bind j select-pane -D
    bind k select-pane -U
    bind l select-pane -R

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `%`       | Split the current pane into two, left and right. |
| `"`       | Split the current pane into two, top and bottom. |

## Configuring tmux

Tmux can be configured via a configuration at `~/.tmux.conf`.

Depending on your tmux version, there is different options available.

### Vi-style copy and paste

```sh
# Vi copypaste mode
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
bind-key -t vi-copy 'v' begin-selection
bind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-selection
```

### Aggressive resizing for clients

```sh
setw -g aggressive-resize on
```

### Reload config

`<Prefix>` + `r`.

```sh
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display-message "Config reloaded."
```

### Status lines

Tmux allows configuring a status line that displays system information,
window list, and even pipe in the `stdout` of an application.

You can use [tmux-mem-cpu-load][tmux-mem-cpu-load] to get stats (requires compilation) and
[basic-cpu-and-memory.tmux][basic-cpu-and-memory.tmux]. You can pipe in a bash command to a tmux
status line like:

```sh
$(shell-command)
```

So if `/usr/local/bin/tmux-mem-cpu-load` outputs stats to `stdout`, then
`$(tmux-mem-cpu-load)` is going to output the first line to the status
line. The interval is determined by the `status-interval`:

    set -g status-interval 1

[basic-cpu-and-memory.tmux]: https://github.com/zaiste/tmuxified/blob/master/scripts/basic-cpu-and-memory.tmux

### Examples

- <https://github.com/tony/tmux-config> - works with tmux 1.5+.
  Supports screen's `ctrl-a` `Prefix key`. Support for system cpu,
  memory, uptime stats.
