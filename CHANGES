  ``tmux`` not found in system PATH
- :support:`-` major internal overhaul of :class:`Server`, :class:`Session`
  , :class:`Window`, and :class:`Pane` continues.

  - :class:`Server` has @property :meth:`Server.sessions`, which is forward
    to :meth:`Server.list_sessions()` (kept to keep tmux commands in
    serendipty with api), :meth:`Server._list_sessions()` returns dict
    object from :meth:`Server.__list_sessions()` tmux command.
    :meth:`Server.__list_sessions()` exists to keep the command layered so
    it can be tested against in a matrix with travis and compatibility
    methods can be made.

  - :class:`Session` now has @proprety :meth:`Session.windows` returning a
    list of  :class:`Window` objects via :meth:`Session.list_windows()`.
    @property :meth:`Session._windows` to :meth:`Session._list_windows()`
    to return a list of dicts without making objects.

  - :class:`Window` now has @proprety :meth:`Window.panes` returning a
    list of :class:`Pane` objects via :meth:`Window.list_panes()`.
    @property :meth:`Window._panes` to :meth:`Window._list_panes()`
    to return a list of dicts without making objects.

- :release:`0.1-dev <2013-10-18>`
- :support:`-` major internal overhaul of :class:`Server`, :class:`Session`,
  :class:`Window`, and :class:`Pane`. 

  - ``Session``, ``Window`` and ``Pane`` now refer to a data object
    in :class:`Server` internally and always pull the freshest data.

  - A lot of code and complexity regarding setting new data for objects
    has been reduced since objects use their unique key identifier to
    filter their objects through the windows and panes in ``Server``
    object.

  - ``Server`` object is what does the updating now.
- [project] some research into supporting legacy tmux versions. tmux 1.6
  and 1.7 support seem likely eventually if there is enough demand.
- :support:`-` python 3 support

- :release:`0.1-dev <2013-10-17>`

- :support:`-` Server is now a subclass of ``util.TmuxObject``.
- :support:`-` subclasses of :class:`util.TmuxRelationalObject`,
  :class:`Server`, :class:`Session`, :class:`Window`, :class:`Pane` now
  have :meth:`util.TmuxRelationalObject.getById` (similar to `.get()`_ in
  `backbone.js`_ collection), :meth:`util.TmuxRelationalObject.where` and
  :meth:`util.TmuxRelationalObject.findWhere` (`.where()`_ and
  `.findWhere()`_ in `underscore.js`_), to easily find child objects.
- :support:`-` tmux object mapping has been split into
  :class:`util.TmuxMappingObject`. The mapping and the relational has been
  decoupled to allow :class:`Server` to have children while not being a
  dict-like object.
- :support:`-` :class:`Server`, :class:`Session`, :class:`Window`,
  :class:`Pane` now explicitly mixin subclasses.
